# Trello CORS Proxy for Cloudflare Workers

Securely streams private Trello attachment URLs to bypass CORS restrictions in Power-Up apps.

Converts `x-trello-auth` request header to Authorization header.

## Cloudflare Worker deployment

The CORS proxy located in `index.js` can now be
deployed automatically through Cloudflare's GitHub connector. The Worker reads
an `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_DOMAIN` environment variable (a comma-separated list of
domains) to decide which Trello Power-Up origins can use the proxy. If the
variable is not set, it defaults to `yourdomain.com` so the previous manual
behaviour still works.

1. Update `src/cloudflare-worker-cors-proxy/wrangler.toml` if required:
   - Change the `name` field to match your Worker name in Cloudflare.
   - Optionally remove the default `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_DOMAIN` value because the
     deployment will override it with a build variable.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard create (or open) your Worker and go to the
   **Deployments** tab. Choose **Connect to Git** and select this repository and
   the branch you want to deploy.
3. Set the connector options:
   - **Root Directory**: `src/cloudflare-worker-cors-proxy`
   - **Build command**: leave empty (Cloudflare will upload `index.js` directly
     using the Wrangler configuration).
   - **Build output directory**: leave empty.
4. After the repository is connected, open the Worker **Settings â†’ Variables**
   page and add a plain text variable named `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_DOMAIN`. Enter the
   domain (or comma-separated domains) that should be able to call the proxy,
   such as `yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com,admin.yourdomain.com`.
5. Trigger a deployment from Cloudflare or by merging a commit into the linked
   branch. The Worker will be published automatically with the updated source.
